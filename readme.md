This is my solution for the CS 188 Fall 2024 Pacman AI project.
By the University of California, Berkeley.
https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa24/projects/proj1/

The editable files are:
- `searchAgents.py`: contains my implementation of the search agents
- `search.py`: contains my implementation of the search algorithms
- `util.py`: contains my implementation of the utility functions

You can test the code by running `python autograder.py` in the terminal.
